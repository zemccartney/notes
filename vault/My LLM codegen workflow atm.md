Opened my AIs to how much more rigor I could take to working with AI. Regardless of feelings about AI and impact on society, imperative to learn how to work with them, I think? Feels like a matter of career survival, to show currency with AI tooling.

I find it impossible to tell how well this workflow or any others work. Extreme difficulty of AI: output space feels so massive, systems are probabilistic, so feels impossible to decipher cause and effect, how my prompting effected the AI's output, what I could change to get more desirable results. If nothing else, having a workflow like this to simplify experimenting has been really useful. Keep throwing things at the AI, write down what you learn, see what sticks, I guess.
