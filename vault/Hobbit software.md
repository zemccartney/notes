> Now thinking about creating a movement to promote "hobbit software". Pretty chill, keeps to itself, tends to its databases, hangs out with other hobbit software at the pub, broadly unbothered by the scheming of the wizards and the orcs, oblivious to the rise and fall of software empires around them.

Thinking about Mark Zuckerberg calling the head of WhatsApp unambitious, per the Vergecast, episode on 4/18/2025, because they were uninterested in scaling to billions of users. The Verge folks said the WhatsApp folks wanted to be more like Craigslist. I don't know how anecdotal, but hits why I love this post: purpose of software not to grow without limit, with no purpose other than to grow and amass wealth, but to live a good life, do things you enjoy, provide some value and amusement and happiness for people, maybe, but mainly being a decent citizen and keeping to yourself. And it's a shame Zuckerberg's imperial ambitiousness is so glorified, historically (not him specifically, the general idea): seems more that people like him are outing themselves as socially irresponsible
