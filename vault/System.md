## Categories

### reading

blogmarks, as Simon Willison calls them. Capturing things read. Titles of posts are article titles. Intend to link titles via source property (see below), group by date read

#### properties
- source: link to piece
- author: name(s) of the writer(s) / producer(s)
- via: link that led to finding the piece

### resources

capture more formal documents of processes I use in my work, mainly so I have the thing written down in a known, central place. Think checklists, procedures, etc. 

Unclear how useful this'll be; we'll see!

### til

Follow https://github.com/jbranchaud/til

> A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post.


## TODOs

- [ ] how to deal with link rot? Document author and title when giving links, don't just post links?
