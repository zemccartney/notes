title: If nothing is curated, how do we find things?

Discussion to be had about the limitations and politics of human critics, some counterpoints to framing in this piece, I'm sure. As in, I might quibble with the conclusion a bit, but the path there, not at all:

> As convenient as social media is, it scatters the information like bread being fed to ducks. You then have to hunt around for the info or hope the magical algorithm gods read your mind and guide the information to you.
> 
> I always felt like social media creates an illusion of convenience. Think of how much time it takes to stay on top of things. To stay on top of music or film. Think of how much time it takes these days, how much hunting you have to do. Although technology has made information vast and reachable, it's also turned the entire internet into a sludge pile. And now, instead of relying on professional curators to sort through things for us, now _we_ have to do the sorting.

And more (fighting to not paste the whole thing)

> It makes art (music, film, tv, etc.) seem like one big sludge pile. It makes it feel vast and exhausting, like an endless list of things that you'll never get to the end of. I've been noticing this sentiment with society, this feeling of always being mentally exhausted. How many times have we had a discussion with a friend who was recommending a show and our response was, "Oh yeah, I'll have to see it, but my list of shows is so long!" The reality is we're not going to watch it because we feel like we have no time to get through everything and we don't fully trust other people's recommendations.

That exhaustion is so familiar. I was sick recently, gave up on "keeping up" entirely, slept a lot, read books, watched movies, and felt more rested than I had in years. Highlighted the drag of the constant "endless list". Part of the issue is that I'm shit at curating and generally directionless, I'm not sure what I actually like. But the sludge pile is real and I feel pressure to participate: to be some semblance of an informed citizen, to have interests, to keep pace with my career industry. Thought right back to [[The Gruen Transfer is consuming the internet]]. Those pressures, bringing you to the online grocery store, then pulled away in the ebb. Tabs on my phone for later, tabs on my work and personal computers for later, shows to watch, reminders.

Like the expansion of social media has led to the feeling that I need to stay connected, developed into an instinct, a kneejerk to stay connected. A dependency. "Illusion of convenience" is the perfect phrase.
