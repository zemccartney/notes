A classic I'd been meaning to read for years, stashed in tabs forgotten over and over. A truly awesome piece. So many thoughts.

First, an aside, quoting Corey Ginnivan:

> > I’d love more job descriptions to be **more vulnerable** and open — let people know what you want to achieve, specify what they’ll be working on, but open it as a growth opportunity for both parties.

Love this idea. Focusing on goals over tooling. Tooling changes, programming as theory and skills builds forever.


Generally, a good reminder to think critically about public discourse, who's loudest, who they work for, who might not be speaking that much. Corporate environments and small agencies are vastly underrepresented proportionate to how many people work in those environments. And esonates on why I built my personal site without a framework, with very little js, and the little I use is vanilla, using gulp as a build tool. Clunky, "dumb"? Sure. but it's lovely to work on, easy to pick back up, and optimized for my discovery, learning, experimentation, really, doing whatever I want. And I fucking love that.

> Is there any solution to these problems of suffering craftsmanship and skill devaluation? Are the problems systemic and deeply rooted, or are they surface level and without severe consequence? Is the divide real, or a temporary rift? Is the friction settling down or heating up? Will the front-end developer skillset widen or narrow as the years pass? Let’s keep talking about this!

Craftsmanship. Addy Osmani talked about this in [[The 70% problem - Hard truths about AI-assisted coding]], that AI may enable an increased focus on craftsmanship when highly functional software becomes table stakes. But to me, this collides a bit with Chris' point here (my understanding of it, at least), that overloading developers, that dividing and devaluing skills, has led to an erosion in craftsmanship (And note, Chris was writing years before this current AI hype wave). If the direction of AI is asking developers to become product engineers or managers or system thinkers or whatever you want to call it, are we immediately offsetting the free time of writing code with immediately ratcheting up the demands on developers? This feels maybe a bit harsh, and likely overextending Osmani's discussion (I'm not trying to put words in his mouth). But I do worry about the economics of it all; faster production hasn't historically meant slowing down to care about quality (without regulation, which.... not looking great at the moment).

More than anything, I thought of [[The Static Site Paradox]]. What's our imperative, as web developers? What does the technological direction of the web mean for society? Who benefits from ratcheting up complexity and increasing reliance on infrastructure?

Building simpler, for the small web...
