>One major piece of baggage we accrue is the belief that if we’re not visibly active, we’re not learning. This is incorrect. Learning requires time to reflect. It requires discussing what you’ve learned and [letting your mind wander](https://fs.blog/2019/10/focused-diffuse-thinking/). You need to let go of trying to _look_ smart, and focus instead on trying to _be_ smart.

Oof. I struggle so terribly with this, inner dialog always bubbles up with the thought that I'm not learning when struggling. And the tendency to prioritize looking smart over actual competency ... again, oof. Helpful reminder.

And further emphasis of the important point of [[Wasting years by not wasting hours]]
