I wanted to store this to keep in mind when working on my personal site, driven by similarish ideas. Ideas that feel more and more imperative (see [[The Static Site Paradox]]).

I love the constraint of "Find ways to let the user store their own data.". I hadn't thought about this much, but, speaking from my experience of recently picking up Obsidian, it's revelatory. You know exactly where your work is, leaving the tool or the platform or the whatever is a non-concern: they don't own anything of yours, just the convenience they offer.

>I hear so much about software never being finished. But I think, these little apps _can_ and _should_ be finished. They should reach a state where they are complete.

Netflix and really all streaming services should take a queue from this. One good season of a show doesn't justify 4 more near-unwatchable seasons. Ha. Anyway.

It's nice, thinking about building for the web as creating small, useful things, sharing with others that way.
