Some highlights from a really interesting conversation on how AI stands to reshape application distribution, particularly as it relates to the web and its standing as an open media platform.


"The big one is whether or not AI is a new user interface that creates a new generation of hardware that ends the smartphone application distribution monopoly. Like that's the thing."

"Like, I keep saying this, as a giant, interlinked, interconnected worldwide application platform, the web is a miracle. It's just you would never be able to predict that something like that could exist. And it does.

It's scale. And everyone just sort of takes it for granted. As a media platform, it's dying.

And one of the reasons it's dying is because there's no way to move traffic around it. And Google was the last way to move it. And I would just say, I don't think they care."

"So whatever you think Google Search did to the web as a media platform, and it did a lot of things. First, it created an entire economy for the web as a media platform, right? People searched for things, they went to webpages, just like revolutionized the internet. Like it created the internet as we know it in like meaningful ways. Then it created SEO, which was less good. Then it created the SEO industry and SEO slop and all this stuff. And it made a whole ecosystem that worked and didn't work in whatever ways it worked. And then even before AI showed up, Google started displaying more and more of the content natively. Right. What time is the Super Bowl went from being a thing that people fought for to a thing that Google would just tell you. And zero-click searches, which is what they were called, were an increasing part of Google's product for just a long time. And the only searches that they would definitely send people to websites for were commercial searches. Stuff where you bought stuff. And they were every, if you look at Google IO over the years, every demo has always ended with a transaction. Because once you're doing commercial searches, you get to charge for advertising. And so you can buy yourself to the top of a commercial search, the top result. You're the winner. You bought the AdWords auction for shoes. You get the shoes click. You bought some shoes. Everyone's happy in Google's ecosystem. And that has led to other weird outcomes, right? Where you search for the name of a product. You get the competitor first because they bought the ad for the name of the product. Weird outcome made Google really rich. That's the web we knew"
