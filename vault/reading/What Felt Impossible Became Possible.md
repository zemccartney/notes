Quoting George Dale

> I lost my advertising, most of my subscribers, my home, my liberty, and every dollar I had in the world. I lost all but a few loyal friends, my devoted family, and all but lost my newspaper but thank god I retained the pearl of great priceâ€”my self respect.

So much of modern life feels like trading small measures of self-respect in exchange for convenience and entertainment. Reminds me of this line from a [Brain Food newsletter](https://fs.blog/brain-food/april-27-2025/) a while back: "The quicker you want something, the easier it is to manipulate you." Which all pales in comparison to the horrors of the Klan and fascism of the current US administration. But all tied together in a sense: forces that drive people to speak and act against others instead of pursuing good for themselves and others.
