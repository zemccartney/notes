> ### 3. Mistakes teach better than shortcuts
> When I make mistakes, I learn. Debugging my own failures has always been one of the best ways to understand a new language or concept. Relying on AI to “fix” things for me short-circuited that learning process. As a result, I’m left with no deeper understanding of Zig than when I started.

Really hit home for me. These lines up pretty well my first experience with AI, really leaning on Github Copilot to "relearn" PHP, specifically Wordpress, at a new job. I did find that I incidentally discovered a lot of Wordpress' built-in functions from reviewing copilot's output, but I learned the most from digging into Wordpress' documentation, specifically guides and best practices, not just reference material - how to think in Wordpress - and, relevant here, looking back on the codebase I'd stapled together following AI and feeling despondent (I did end up refactoring a lot; also very educational! also too little too late; at least this guy's story happened in his garage, with only himself as collateral damage. lots of apologies for my coworkers ahead)

I loved the learnings spelled out at the end of this piece. That friction and mistakes in programming force you to think and improve your work and learn and become more capable at building and maintaining your work. AI takes so much of that away.

And yes, part of this is that I’m fully expecting that programming skills will lower in demand and disappear and I’m stressed about losing my job and never working again. Because why wouldn’t I be? Why shouldn’t I be frustrated that a bunch of shitty monopolists have unleashed a labor-destroying tool on the world with essentially no oversight or regulation or care for impact on day-to-day life and have profited obscenely from said carelessness and all around social media I see working people cheering this on and evangelizing AI as if they’re also not orders of magnitude too poor for that opinion to make sense?  Oh well.
