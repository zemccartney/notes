> ### 3. Mistakes teach better than shortcuts
> When I make mistakes, I learn. Debugging my own failures has always been one of the best ways to understand a new language or concept. Relying on AI to “fix” things for me short-circuited that learning process. As a result, I’m left with no deeper understanding of Zig than when I started.

Really hit home for me. These lines up pretty well my first experience with AI, really leaning on Github Copilot to "relearn" PHP, specifically Wordpress, at a new job. I did find that I incidentally discovered a lot of Wordpress' built-in functions from reviewing copilot's output, but I learned the most from digging into Wordpress' documentation, specifically guides and best practices, not just reference material - how to think in Wordpress - and, relevant here, looking back on the codebase I'd stapled together following AI and feeling despondent (I did end up refactoring a lot; also very educational! also too little too late; at least this guy's story happened in his garage, with only himself as collateral damage. lots of apologies for my coworkers ahead)
