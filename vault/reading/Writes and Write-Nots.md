I agree with this wholeheartedly and extends to my thinking on AI re: programming. I like to program. Something happens in my brain by actively writing code. Code isn’t just an output, but a process. Programming generally feels shittier, is less fulfilling, using AI. I don’t mind having an AI reformat some JSON or some other uninteresting business like that, but I feel my eyes glaze over and deactivate having to review a pile of AI-generated code, however sound it might be. Immediately disengaging.
