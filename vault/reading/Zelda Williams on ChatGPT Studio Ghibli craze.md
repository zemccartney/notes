Here entire quote is excellent, but in particular:

> I can't stop you from using the stupid, water wasting, shitty facsimile machines, in the same way you can't stop me from talking about how deeply empty life will become if we relegate the pursuit of art or knowledge to a machine because some people don't like the effort of learning, whether that's an artistic skill or homework in school. Lazy doesn't just effect the body, it rots the mind.
