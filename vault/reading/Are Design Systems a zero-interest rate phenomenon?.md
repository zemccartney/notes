> There’s no particular “hair on fire” problem that design systems solve that instantly sells to management. This can be frustrating to design system practitioners because we understand the intrinsic benefits of consistent UI over one-off solutions and maintenance nightmares. We trade immediacy in the short term for predictability over the long tail. In that way, design systems are a _proactive_ solution to a whole host of _likely_ problems down the road. Thus only forward-looking organizations can invest in design systems and to be forward-looking you probably need extra cash on hand… which might make it a zero-interest rate phenomenon.

Predicting the long tail, weighing up front cost of establishing system. How painful will that "hair on fire" be if we build things from the hip?
