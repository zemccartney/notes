Helpful intuition for relationship between yourself the human and the robot: weird-brained, creative, branching, balanced by plainer thought, but more detail: the "smart duck"

> the creativity of humans still have an edge, we are capable of really thinking out of the box, envisioning strange and imprecise solutions that can work better than others. This is something that is extremely hard for LLMs. Still, to verify all my ideas, Gemini was very useful, and maybe I started to think at the problem in such terms because I had a “smart duck” to talk with.
