Resonated with my own experience trying to build a writing habit: constant struggle to be authentic to yourself, to actually care about what you write about, to think deeply on and criticize your own thoughts. Really get to the bottom of yourself. Writing not as the mechanical act of words-to-the-page, but exactly the things this pieces describes, pushing yourself out into the world, finding what you like to do.

> Best of all? It’ll attract like-minded followers — people who love the work _you_ like to create.
