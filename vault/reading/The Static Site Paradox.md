>only few professional software engineers can “afford” to have the second option \["a collection of static HTML files and one or two CSS files. No JavaScript anywhere".] as their personal website, and almost all normal users are stuck with overcomplicated solutions.

 I'm exactly the case of professional dev he describes: my personal site is frameworkless, pretty bare bones, static files with a gulp pipeline to do some image processing and css optimization.
 
And quoting his own talk, later:

> >**the web doesn’t belong just to software engineers**. The more we make the web complex, the more we push normal users into the enclosures that we like to call _social networks_.
> > 
> >Don’t you find it infuriating when lawyers and accountants fail to clarify how their respective domains work, making them unavoidable intermediaries of systems that in theory you should be able to navigate by yourself?
> > 
> > **Whenever we fail to make simple things easy in software engineering, and webdev especially, we are failing society in the exact same way.**
> > 
> > This is not something that startups or big tech can solve for us, their economic incentives are just too misaligned, so I invite you all to help make the web more accessible, partially as a matter of taking pride in our craft, and partially because the web used to be more interesting when more of it was made by people different from us.


I don't know what to make of this yet. I feel sad, though. Big tech's shadow feels very large and ominous these days.
