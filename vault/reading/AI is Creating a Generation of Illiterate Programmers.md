>Every time we let AI solve a problem we could’ve solved ourselves, we’re trading long-term understanding for short-term productivity. We’re optimizing for today’s commit at the cost of tomorrow’s ability.

Who benefits from this loss of ability in the workplace? From people thinking less, becoming less skilled? Who’s pushing these AI systems so hard? Tech monopolists might not actually benefit from this, per se, but I doubt they care one bit about the societal consequences of building a massive paid public dependency on tools that make people stupider.

That said, I see the counterargument: how much do people lose by offloading uninteresting, utility work, small one-off tools or prototypes, to AI? Or tools they find useful, but not useful enough to ever justify spending the time to figure out how to build? These small, more niche, but still specifically useful projects (Simon Willison's work comes to mind)... feels like a line to navigate here, something to think on
