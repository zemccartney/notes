From Nilay Patel:

> When you see people tweeting information that was already public and pretending it was a secret, you should immediately distrust that person. Like, that information has been available for a long time and saying I'm revealing it now or it leaked now or Elon made it transparent now or especially when you see a screenshot of that website \[https://www.usaspending.gov/\] in particular, that's how you know they're grifting you.
