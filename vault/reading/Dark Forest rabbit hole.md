- Which linked to:
	- [*AI: Markets for Lemons, and the Great Logging Off*](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/) by Lars Doucet
	- And [*The dark forest theory of the internet*](https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/) by Yancey Strickler

Started with Maggie Appleton's piece, rabbit holed to the others. Powerful metaphor, online life as the dark forest, advertisers and bots and AI crawlers, especially, as predators.

What the fuck do you do with all of this? This is Twitter today, basically: a flood of AI shit and AI enthusiasts touting how quickly they can pump out things that are beneficial to people’s lives with AI. Beneficial how? To what ends are people living any more? No incentive for effort or thought, so the most opportunistic and careless and selfish thrive. That’s simplistic and careless, too, but it’s so frustrating. It genuinely is depressing, existing online these days. Part of why I assume so many people have migrated to bluesky; it feels notably more human, for lack of a better phrase, than Twitter.

Appleton’s note on working harder to be intelligent:

> As both consumers of content and creators of it, we’ll have to foster a greater sense of critical thinking and scepticism. This all sounds a bit rough, but there’s a lot of hope in this vision. In a world of automated intelligence, our goalposts for intelligence will shift. We’ll raise our quality bar for what we expect from humans

As it relates to Doucet's note that “lemons should be understood as a form of market pollution, and if enough of them build up you wind up in a [Red Queen's Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen's_race?ref=fortressofdoors.com) to outpace them, risking a death spiral”

Heart-breaking, having to list out ways to prove our humanity, for those of us who feel more fulfilled from interacting with actual people and feel offput by how AI has affected online life, who want, as Strickler puts it, “spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments”

Strickler’s reflection that conscientious people leaving online spaces just makes them more dangerous for those remaining, more concentratedly polluted, which feels like essentially the same idea as Doucet's point that “The surest sign of a market for lemons is when everything for sale is garbage, and nobody has an incentive to put something up for sale that's not garbage, because they have no way to credibly signal their offerings aren't garbage, too.”
