Serendipitously, ran into this piece right after reading Julia Evans' [*Help! I have a manager!*](http://wizardzines.com/zines/manager/). Let lots of thoughts smushing around my skull, reflecting on how underthought and lacking intentionality many of my interactions with managers have been over the years. Area for growth

The tie between the two: transitioning negativity and complaints, however justified, to productive conversation. Introspecting, what your manager can actually do you for you, what you actually want. Not to commiserate; your manager is a resource; how can they get you to where you want to go? You have to tell them where where is first

But if nothing else, maybe a useful mental model, that might stick (emphasis mine)

> - Your role as a manager is also to be a perspective-creator. Sure, that salesperson was overly optimistic on how impactful this custom feature was for a prospect. And sure, the deal wasn’t as large and didn’t close as quickly as they said it would. But sales incentives are a law of the universe, and sales directors need to manage around them just as much as product teams do, because _not_ having sales incentives is even worse. And by the way, we’re not so great at estimating development timelines either. **Everyone’s blood pressure should always be lower after they’ve spoken to you.**
