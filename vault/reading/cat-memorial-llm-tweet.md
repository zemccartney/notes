Reposting in full here in case Twitter further nukes itself

If you read nothing else: "I don't think this thread is going to move the needle on regulation, but I wanted to express my feelings about how our culture values the fidelity and believability of visual spectacle more than the context, craft, conditions & relationships that produce it. More than the people"

And then see [[the-who-cares-era]]. AI as part of cultural enshrinement of hoarding and scamming over caring about and actually liking things

CW death I recently held my cat and watched as the light left her eyes and I babbled "but she's so small" through sobs. When the vet took her from me her head shifted and it looked for a second like she was alive and had moved, and i realized she would never move again.

I feel strongly, unironically, this video [Sora video of a cat walking] mocks life. Moreover, it mocks the relationships and bonds, the communication, ideas and stories that make up life. Sora, like all LLMs, generates by statistically amalgamating data. In this case, endless footage captured of cats.

Footage that required not just human intention to capture, express, celebrate and share aspects and behaviors of cats meaningful to us, but required cats to trust, bond or feel comfortable with the people photographing them. It required a relationship, a context, and life.

An LLM like Sora can only chop up and reassemble all of these memories, these records of life and work and intent and meaning into a Frankensteins monster of statistically significant positions and shapes. A composite corpse strung up in a pantomime of life by way of spreadsheet

It is cruel and strange that we are threatened and informed this is the future of human expression, that it is here to replace all thought, care, intention, effort or meaning crafted by humans, things we previously accepted as the materials which wholly define expression

It is cruel and strange that we are threatened and informed this is the future of human expression, that it is here to replace all thought, care, intention, effort or meaning crafted by humans, things we previously accepted as the materials which wholly define expression

We are told to accept that our art--records of our struggle to understand our place in the world--will be carved up and sewn to a shambling corpse of mismatched parts without thought, and that we must accept this lurid golem will replace all future endeavors to express life.

This unthinking corpse composed of data points divorced from their original cats and contexts in time and space, with its eyes that don't blink and legs that phase through solid matter, is supposed to be an acceptable totem of our relationship to and understanding of cats

My baby girl and I had a context and relationship and history that was specific to us and matters deeply to me. She was not a series of parts and behaviors to be anonymously sewn to other cat parts also stripped of context, and I would never consent to her being treated as such

I don't think this thread is going to move the needle on regulation, but I wanted to express my feelings about how our culture values the fidelity and believability of visual spectacle more than the context, craft, conditions & relationships that produce it. More than the people

i'm happy people have resonated with this so much, I nearly didn't post. I really miss my little lady and the time we had together that existed just for us. I feel strongly it is wrong for tech companies to use ppls' memories and expressions without asking for simple profit

im getting annoyed people are calling me sanctimonious and incoherent so i'm going to TLDR it for people who get confused when others express their feelings: AI companies shouldn't be able to use and profit off of data they don't own without consent. Really simple.

Reading comments from people who can relate or are going through something similar has helped me a lot, thank you
