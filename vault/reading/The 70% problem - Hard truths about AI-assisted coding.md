>There's a deeper issue here: The very thing that makes AI coding tools accessible to non-engineers - their ability to handle complexity on your behalf - can actually impede learning. When code just "appears" without you understanding the underlying principles:
>
>- You don't develop debugging skills
>- You miss learning fundamental patterns   
>- You can't reason about architectural decisions
>- You struggle to maintain and evolve the code   
>This creates a dependency where you need to keep going back to AI to fix issues, rather than developing the expertise to handle them yourself

Made me think back to [[My Afternoon Project Turned Into Four Days of AI Lies, USB Chaos, and Hard Lessons]], on how AI doesn't teach you much on its own. It's a passive tool. You need to take responsibility for learning from it, still.

>AI isn't making our software dramatically better because software quality was (perhaps) never primarily limited by coding speed. The hard parts of software development – understanding requirements, designing maintainable systems, handling edge cases, ensuring security and performance – still require human judgment.

And this echoes some of the sentiment of [[Programming as Theory Building]], that program text is incidental. The question is if leaning on AI actually enables people to think more about these details. And personally, finding time to focus on and build the skills now more valuable / necessary to stay competitive and gainfully employed long enough to retire, which he references:

> This shift towards agentic development will require us to evolve our skills:
>
>- Stronger system design and architectural thinking  
>- Better requirement specification and communication    
>- More focus on quality assurance and validation   
>- Enhanced collaboration between human and AI capabilities

I don't know. it's hard to not view software as, increasingly, a market of lemons. Does investing in those skills, to build higher quality software, really stand out, not just to users, but to people thinking of spending money to hire programmers? How valuable is that, still? (commercially and professionally I mean, disregarding, sadly, how I feel about programming as a hobby, something I enjoy doing for fun)
