## Mac setup notes

- ran into issue with fnm, turned out to be incorrect installation path
	- https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/issues/824

### git

- ended up trying https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html
	- per https://github.com/ai/environment/blob/main/gitconfig 
	- looks like won't work with astro, though
- for ssh https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent 
- rectangle
	- ok, kind of get it after using it, seems pretty cool
	- remember to set as login itme
	- curious how often I'll actually end up using it, but nice to have

### purepaste 

- enabled most settings, except for list normalization
- keep an eye on it
