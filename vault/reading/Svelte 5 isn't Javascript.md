As someone who wants to keep his job as a programmer for the foreseeable future and have some hope of retiring, who really likes programming, who feels alienated by AI tooling turning me into more code reviewer than active participant while shrinking career prospects by the hour, this really hit home

"Good software is built on understanding, not cleverness." 

I really hope there's something to this, that the understanding behind the scenes, the process, matters and not just value delivered to consumers as fast as possible. But does anyone really care how well-understand software is, as long as it does what they want? Is there any remaining economic value to understanding? I can't pay my bills with caring about knowing how my projects work. Oh well
