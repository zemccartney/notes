Staggeringly good. An incredible writer.

Side thought: pressure to not care, to push for convenience, material conditions of a society engineered around always maximizing, grow as big as fast as possible with 0 thought to any and all repercussions. When you live in that riptide, what's incentive to care? Care is swimming upstream.
