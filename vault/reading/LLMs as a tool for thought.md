> the focus isn’t on "creating something". Gaining distance from thoughts as a way to evolve them. A good tool for thought is an extension of your mind.

Thought about this the other day, how sourcing a recipe feels very different looking up in a cookbook vs. looking up online. The latter: I have an idea of what I want, I query, I see some rough matches, narrow down from there. The former: constrained by what’s in the book, more time spent in open-ended search, material experience; slower, less efficient, higher risk of dissatisfaction, not finding something you want, but I’ve found much higher payoff in surprise of discovery, and really, leafing through a book, seeing stains on pages from when you had the book open cooking last. I don’t know how to articulate, yet: there’s some … spiritual? Value in working slowly, in posing questions first and not answers, in surprise.

Loved this point; implicitly understood, but never heard it stated explicitly, helpful mental model
