> They _already_ deal with every employee that they’ve ever had who was not a doormat at negotiations, **which includes essentially all of the employees they really value**.  Ramit Sethi (more on him later) introduced me to a concept that he calls Competence Triggers: basically, if you have to judge someone’s skill based on a series of brief interactions, you’re going to pattern match their behavior against other people who you like.  When people with hiring authority think of winners, they think of _people like them_ who live and breathe this business thing.  They negotiate things as a matter of course: that is a major portion of the value they bring to the company.  Volunteering a number when asked says the same thing to people with hiring authority that flunking FizzBuzz says to an engineer: this person may be a wonderful snowflake in other regards, but on the thing I care about, they’re catastrophically incompetent.  It will also cause them to retroactively question competencies they’d previously credited you with.

Highlighting for no particular reason. Remembering: competence triggers

I really wish I'd read this approximately 11 years earlier in my (at time of writing) 11-years-old career.
