> We've all experienced it, and now it's starting to consume the internet. It first appeared on Facebook, with the introduction of the feed. Originally intended as a way to simplify updates from your friends, and hold your attention captive for longer. However somewhere along the line, the feed became more than that. Facebook now feels more confusing than my local department store, and my original reason for visiting (keeping up to date with friends & family) is quickly forgotten. The last time I checked Facebook, maybe 10% of my feed was updates from friends. The rest was a combination of ads, memes, and influencer marketing videos, leaving me doom scrolling endlessly.

Really great piece. Right to the heart of life online these days to the extent that it's mostly partitioned into platforms instead of open browsing. Though doesn't answer or go into (not that this is an easy question at all): why is this so addicting? what's the pull of disorientation and distraction?
