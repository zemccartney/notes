I've been trying to read more in general this year and commit to learning in public, to at least attempt to put effort into having some sort of artifacts of my own learning efforts, hopefully will make said learning stick, if not contribute in some way to public knowledge or otherwise help others. Useful to read through an experienced practitioner's take on how to do something like this.

But the main thing, to keep it simple, so this practice has a chance of sticking: the point, the value, is in showing up and doing the thing, for yourself first.
