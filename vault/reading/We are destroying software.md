My general thought on the advancement of AI: speed to what end? We can supposedly do more with fewer people, but of what value? To whose benefit?

Speed at the expense of care, oversight, and consciousness. I expect things will turn to shit at such a high volume that no one will be able to keep pace and hold tech magnates or really anyone in power to account. Great if you're in charge of the robot factories, though!
