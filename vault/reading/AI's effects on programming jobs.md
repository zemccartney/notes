> The net result of all of this for the programming market is: more software, better software, more programmers, better programmers. But the adjustment won't be without pain: some shitty software will get shipped before we figure out how to put guardrails around AI-driven development. Some programmers who are currently shipping mediocre software will find themselves replaced by newer, faster, AI-assisted developers before they manage to learn AI tools themselves. Everyone will have a lot of learning to do. But what else is new? Software development has always evolved rapidly. Embrace change, and you'll be fine.

> And I think I've decided on a name for this new type of AI-assisted developer: we can call them software developers. Giving them some other name will create gatekeeping where none needs to exist, it will falsely imply they can never move down the stack. I've been in this game too long to fall into that trap. They develop software, so they are software developers. That's the only qualification they need.

I really appreciate a more balanced take on the prospects of the software dev market. Personally, I do like the idea that I might still be employable in a few years :) I'm not sure I buy all of Laurie's points, not that I disagree, just they offer a lot to think about and it feels impossible to parse how AI will affect the world at large and my career specifically. I also won't be surprised if the web dev job market bottoms out at an alarming rate. We'll see.

The salient point: a much needed reminder to get over yourself and learn and adapt. If I'm really honest with myself, I have been feeling defensive about AI re: how murky it's made the future seem, at a time when the state of the US feels outright apocalyptic. I have serious concerns about how the people who control AI tools will shape the world (those same people were recently hanging out at the White House, after all) and believe the tech sector at large deserves zero benefit of the doubt. But that's a separate concern, and one that's hard to keep separate, from me feeling insecure about my own capabilities in light of AI's emergence.

A corollary, I might add: as always, to stay humble; there's too much to learn in software development and it's impossible for anyone to conceive of every layer of the stack we depend on every day (and you don't need to!). That is, we're all depending on the knowledge built up by those that came before us and everyone's a dummy and more than capable of showing it. Times a million for AI, massive capability out of a black box, massive opportunity to build bad, vulnerable software. Hence all the dunking on [this guy.](https://x.com/pr0grammerhum0r/status/1901695054554488886) Some of that's gatekeeping, sure. But some of it seems like people rightly pointing out that development speed doesn't absolve you of caring about critical details like, uh, securing your API :)
