Love it. Such useful advice. I’m definitely very guilty of splitting up identifiers and have certainly suffered as a result. Fair to say prioritizing “elegance” over utility.

And I’m also guilty of renaming at application boundaries.

Greppability feels like a very useful intuition for thinking about code authorship in general (jokes about naming is hard aside, they’re so clearly calling out here). How to use words consistently and simply to make life easier for yourself and others? A codebase is a dynamic dictionary, words that do things over time: how do you find those words to figure out everything they do?

And ffs, extremely guilty of all the nesting, namely in react land. Oof. 0/3. Go figure.

Overarching theme is to notice the drive to changes for the sake of perceived elegance. It's fine to be boring. Boring is more easily learnable a month from now.
