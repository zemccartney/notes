Writing as memorializing; this thought, this intuition, caught me, listening in my car. How healthy it is for your soul to stop and like things. tough these days


"Yeah, and in 2025, I think there's so many ways to talk about media, right? And I was thinking the other day when the Knicks beat the Celtics, I'm like, this is like a cool thing to have happened to something I'm interested in. And I'm like, I hope someone writes something beautiful about it because I want to remember it. And maybe that's us. But like, I want someone to put this into words. I want someone to write a poem or song about it because all these things are fleeting, right? And I think someone like Sacha would see the thing he was interested in, rap music, and be like, I will put words to this to memorialize it, but also to celebrate it. And that's where the art comes into it. And I miss these people. I think I don't want to sound like a boomer, but you don't get likes by liking things. And unless great thinkers are incentivized to talk about their appreciation of a scene and dedication and tenacity ... we don't look the same. Art doesn't look the same. Writers don't look the same. Sacha did something that happened almost a quarter century ago"
