Very cool. Need to take time to process, but felt like a useful perspective. Granted, i’m not super up to date on the latest AI UIs and this article is a couple years old, someone more informed might have useful counterarguments.


> I want to see more tools and fewer operated machines - we should be embracing our humanity instead of blindly improving efficiency. And that involves using our new AI technology in more deft ways than generating more content for humans to evaluate. I believe the real game changers are going to have very little to do with plain content generation. Let's build tools that offer suggestions to help us gain clarity in our thinking, let us sculpt prose like clay by manipulating geometry in the latent space, and chain models under the hood to let us move objects (instead of pixels) in a video.

  
Worth thinking about: how can AI applications be designed to encourage human thought, rather than steer toward rote content generation and evaluation?

On the point of blindly improving efficiency, this hit home in thinking about **waves arms wildly at current state of tech kleptocracy**

 AI at its worst seems like a tool for eroding community, devaluing people, devaluating the spiritual health that comes from creative work, all for the sake of … tech execs getting wealthier? already churns out effectively slop. Think of Netflix: it’s basically mostly slop now, lots of bad tv churned out efficiently. Is that what we all want? AI as a tool used to maximize “efficiency,” a tool for leaning into, to use Nilay Patel’s phrase here,[https://bsky.app/profile/reckless.bsky.social/post/3lgnq26s2422a](https://bsky.app/profile/reckless.bsky.social/post/3lgnq26s2422a) “the sort of ruthlessly transactional life modernity demands”. Talking about Donald Trump… I’m going to stand on the belief that people don’t want to live as slop machines, using AI to very efficiently churn out work, no matter the quality.  

I doubt we’ll see much of any restraint around AI, but I liked this piece and her [[Why Chatbots Are Not the Future]] in that they highlight AI’s use not for creation, but for brainstorming, editorial work, zooming out: assisting people over doing things for them, over using AI as a way to dump out work for people to mindlessly review
