> There's a line by the musician/artist [Laurie Anderson](https://dansinker.com/posts/tapeloop/) that I think about a lot: ["This is the time / And this is the record of the time."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2a8fos5NI) _Punk Planet_ was a record—and a product—of _that_ time. Now is different. And that's good. Because now, and tomorrow, is all we have. There's no going backwards, only forward.

> Some of what we did at _Punk Planet_ was groundbreaking (and, here at the end, heartbreaking), but mostly what we did was try and capture the moment we lived in and the people living through it the best we could, because if we didn't, who would. That's not all that unique. You could start that today. You _should_ start that today. Because today is also a time, and it begs for a record of the time.

> I don't know how to end except to say that things end. _Punk Planet_ came to an end in August of 2007. It was the hardest day. The ache in me from it is still very real. But _I_ didn't end. The people who contributed their talents and ideas and love and care to the magazine didn't end. The people influenced by the magazine, and the people who'd go on to be influenced by those people didn't end.

I wish I could write like this. So so good.
