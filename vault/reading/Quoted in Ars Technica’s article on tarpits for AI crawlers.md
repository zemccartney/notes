> I think AI is just the latest in a long row of technologies, it’s just the most aggressive one: Technologies that are not done for us but to us. The tech sector has been struggling to produce meaningful innovation in a while (I talked about that at last year’s Re:Publica conference in Berlin [https://tante.cc/2024/05/28/empty-innovation-at-republica-2024-rp24/](https://tante.cc/2024/05/28/empty-innovation-at-republica-2024-rp24/) ) so it keeps spitting out more and more things that people feel nobody asked for. Nobody asked for NFTs or the fucking Metaverse. Nobody asked for lying chatbots instead of getting to reach an actual support person that could solve your problems.

>I think this feeling fuels the dynamic: A bit of disappointment in tech and the way it can’t seem to do interesting things anymore and a feeling of tech being built not for the good of anyone but VC investors and a few tech dudes. It feels a bit like the social contract that society and the tech sector/engineering have had (you build useful things and we’re okay with you being well off) has been cancled from one side. And that side now wants to have its toy eat the world. People feel threatened and want the threads to stop. And who can blame them given *points everywhere*.


> And I think that while those systems also are basically just symbols it’s a great sign to see that people are challenging the notion that we all have to do AI now. Because we don’t. It’s a choice. A choice that mostly benefits monopolists.


A great read. I’d listened to this frankly depressing interview with Marc Andreesen earlier in the week:[https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/opinion/marc-andreessen-trump-silicon-valley.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/opinion/marc-andreessen-trump-silicon-valley.html) He’s talking about, essentially, this same social contract. He refers to it as The Deal. But from that roughly same starting point, he summarizes the last 10-15 years of growing distrust of the tech sector as not a stagnation and bloat and corruption of monopolistic tech, but as… rich kids being woke? He doesn’t view tech’s progress as enshittification; he sees no moral problem in how power has centralized in a few companies that now hold outsized influence. He glosses over the lack of meaningful tech regulation over the last couple of decades. I think because he feels entitled to that end. He thinks so little of anyone outside his sphere of uber wealthy that he can’t imagine dissatisfaction with the tech sphere. Him and his friends have just been working and building and minding their own business, that’s all!

  
Struggling to write anything, feeling very frustrated. Depressing that him and others that think like him are now entrenched in the US government or, like Musk, have already engineered a coup to take over government systems.
