>Vibe coding also has a ton to offer experienced developers. I’ve talked before about how [using LLMs for code is difficult](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/)—figuring out what does and doesn’t work is a case of building intuition over time, and there are plenty of hidden sharp edges and traps along the way.
